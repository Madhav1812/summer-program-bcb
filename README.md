# Summer Program in Biostatistics and Computational Biology

I have added the datasets related to the 1000 Genomes Project and single cell RNA sequencing to this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cD0ZCc4nYa1M73Wz1cWugaovrhbtVBVd?usp=sharing). We will use this repository to maintain the code for analyzing and implementing our algorithms. Try downloading the data locally, if there are any issues with this, you can try to import the data directly in R, using packages like googledrive. Additionally, I have added some papers on the Drive link that may be relevant to the discussions we have been having. Do let me know if there are any issues.
